## How to run Kapua on Docker.

You are required to have Docker installed and running.<br>
It is advisable to give to Docker at least 6GB of ram and 2 CPUs. 

### Running
Just simply run:
```bash
./docker-deploy.sh
```

PowerShell scripts are also available for Windows systems:
```bash
.\docker-deploy.ps1
```

### Accessing components
After deployment and startup of containers, they can be accessed at the following endpoints

| Application/Service | Endpoint       | User         | Password       | Others                            |
|---------------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| H2 SQL              | localhost:3306 | kapua        | kapua          | Schema name: `kapuadb`            |
| Elasticsearch       | localhost:9200 |              |                |                                   |
| Broker              | localhost:1883 | kapua-broker | kapua-password |                                   |
| Admin WEB Console   | localhost:8080 | kapua-sys    | kapua-password |                                   |
| REST API endpoint   | localhost:8081 | kapua-sys    | kapua-password | API KEY: `12345678kapua-password` |

### Checking
You can check Docker containers logs to check that everything has started and is running properly, by running:
```bash
docker-compose -f compose/docker-compose.yml logs -f
```

### Tear down
To stop and remove all containers, simply run:
```bash
./docker-undeploy.sh
```

### Advanced options

#### Setting the Kapua version
Other than the default deployment it is possible to run other versions of Kapua.

By default the `latest` version of Kapua will be brought up. 
You can change the version of Kapua by exporting the environment variable `IMAGE_VERSION`. 
Please also remember to checkout the related git tag first.

Example:
```bash
git checkout 1.0.0-M5
export IMAGE_VERSION=1.0.0-M5
./docker-deploy.sh
```

#### Building containers from scratch
If you want to build containers from the code, you'll need to build the whole Kapua Project.

From the project root directory, run:
```bash
mvn clean install -f external/pom.xml
mvn clean install -Pdocker
```

To build also the Admin Web Console container, which is excluded by default, add the `console` profile:
```bash
mvn clean install -f external/pom.xml
mvn clean install -Pconsole,docker
```

After the build has completed follow the steps from the [Running](#Running) section.

#### Enabling SSL

To enable SSL in the Jetty (Console and REST API) and Broker containers, set the `KAPUA_DISABLE_SSL` environment variable to `false`, and other variables according to the desired behavior, **before** running the `docker-deploy.sh` script:

```bash
export KAPUA_DISABLE_SSL=false
```

Additionally, the SSL can be configured in two ways: providing a certificate, a private key and an optional CA chain, or providing a keystore.

##### Providing certificates and private key

To use an existing certificate, a private key and a CA you can set the following environment variables:

- **KAPUA_CRT**: The certificate to use
- **KAPUA_CA**: *Optional* - The CA chain that validates the certificate
- **KAPUA_KEY** The private key for the certificate
- **KAPUA_KEY_PASSWORD** *Optional* - The password for the private key

All the values should be exported as inline values. e.g.:

```bash
export KAPUA_CA=$(cat /path/to/myCA.pem)
export KAPUA_CRT=$(cat /path/to/certificate.crt)
export KAPUA_KEY=$(cat /path/to/private.key)
export KAPUA_KEY_PASSWORD=private_key_password
``` 

##### Providing a Keystore

Otherwise, two environment variables can be used to provide an already existing keystore and its password:

- **KAPUA_KEYSTORE**: The base64 encoded keystore
- **KAPUA_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD**: The password for the keystore

Again, All the values should be exported as inline values. e.g.:

```bash
export KAPUA_KEYSTORE=$(base64 /path/to/keystore.pkcs)
export KAPUA_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=keystore_password
```
